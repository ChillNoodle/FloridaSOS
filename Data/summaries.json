    "summary": "Hurricane Milton ravaged Florida, causing significant damage and death. The storm severely affected Tampa Bay, including the local stadium, leading to concerns about the upcoming Tampa Bay Rays season. Amidst rescue efforts, compelling stories of survival emerged, such as that of a boat captain who clung to a cooler in the Gulf of Mexico. The hurricane also caused the cancellation of Peso Pluma's Tampa and Miami concerts. Florida's Lieutenant Dan Joseph Malinowski's daughter criticized influencers exploiting the tragedy. The death toll now stands at 16, and as residents navigate flooded streets for cleanup, the road to recovery is likely to be arduous.",
